# QuickStart to CSFML, by Enichy
## Getting Started:
### Overview:


CSFML (C Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a library designed for simple and fast development of multimedia applications, particularly games and interactive media. This section will guide you through the process of setting up CSFML for your
development environment.

**Prerequisites:**

*Before you begin, understand this guide is made from Linux, specificially Ubuntu. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:*

- **A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)**
- **CSFML dependencies (like OpenGL, X11, etc.)**

### Installation:
- **Step 1: Install SFML**
  - First, you need to install SFML, as CSFML is a binding to SFML. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
- **Step 2: Install CSFML**
  - Now that SFML is installed, you can proceed to install CSFML. Run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev
```
- **Step 3: Verify Installation**
  - To verify that CSFML is installed correctly, let's create a simple C program that uses CSFML. Open your code editor and create a file named main.c with the following content:
```c
#include <SFML/Graphics.h>
#include <CSFML/Graphics.h>

int main()
{
    sfRenderWindow* window = sfRenderWindow_create(sfVideoMode_getDesktopMode(), "CSFML Example", sfDefaultStyle, NULL);

    while (sfRenderWindow_isOpen(window)) {
        sfEvent event;
        while (sfRenderWindow_pollEvent(window, &event)) {
            if (event.type == sfEvtClosed)
                sfRenderWindow_close(window);
        }
        sfRenderWindow_clear(window, sfBlack);
        sfRenderWindow_display(window);
    }
    sfRenderWindow_destroy(window);
    return 0;
}
```
  - Save the file and compile the program:
```
gcc example.c -o main -lcsfml-graphics -lcsfml-window -lcsfml-system
```
- If the compilation is successful, run the executable:
```
./main
```
You should see a window created by CSFML. If you see one, you've successfully installed CSFML on your Ubuntu system.

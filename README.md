# QuickStart to CSFML, By Enichy
## Getting Started:
### Overview:

CSFML (C Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a library designed for simple and fast development of multimedia applications, particularly games and interactive media. This section will guide you through the process of setting up CSFML for your
development environment.

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin, understand this guide is made from Linux, specificially Ubuntu. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- CMake (version 2.8.12 or higher)
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- CSFML dependencies (like OpenGL, X11, etc.)

### Installation:

**Download CSFML:**
- Visit the official CSFML website or download the source code from the CSFML GitHub repository.

**Build CSFML:**
  - Extract the downloaded archive and navigate to the CSFML directory.
  - Create a build directory (e.g., build/) within the CSFML directory.
  - Open a terminal and navigate to the build directory.
  - Run the following commands:
```
cmake ..
make
```
**Install CSFML:**
  - After successful compilation, install CSFML using the following command:
```
sudo make install
```
**Verify Installation:**
  - To ensure that CSFML is installed correctly, create a simple C program that uses CSFML functions.
  Compile and run the program. If there are no errors, CSFML is installed successfully.

### Updating CSFML:

  If you have an older version of CSFML and want to update it, follow these steps:

- **Update CSFML Source Code:**
